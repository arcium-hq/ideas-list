# Confidential AI on Sensitive Data

## Why
Organizations and individuals possess valuable sensitive data like medical records, financial information, and personal data that could significantly improve AI models. However, traditional AI approaches force data owners to surrender control and receive no compensation while their data gets monetized by large tech companies. This creates an unfair dynamic where data producers lose both privacy and potential revenue, while being unable to benefit from the value their data generates.

## High-level Technical Design
Implement a hybrid approach combining federated learning, secure enclaves, and homomorphic encryption to create a trustless data marketplace where data owners can safely monetize their sensitive data. The system architecture ensures data never leaves its secure environment while enabling controlled access for AI training. Smart contracts automatically manage compensation to data owners based on their data's utility in improving model performance, creating a transparent and fair value exchange system.

## Why is it only possible with Arcium
Arcium's MPC infrastructure provides the essential foundation for a trustless data marketplace that ensures fair compensation while maintaining complete confidentiality. Traditional approaches either require surrendering data control to third parties or keep valuable data siloed and unutilized. Arcium's unique secure multiparty computation enables data owners to monetize their sensitive data without ever exposing it, creating a win-win ecosystem where data owners maintain control and receive payment, AI models improve through access to diverse high-quality data, and regulatory compliance (like GDPR and HIPAA) is maintained throughout the process. This transforms sensitive data from a liability into a revenue-generating asset while preserving privacy and regulatory compliance.
